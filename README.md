# Section-Complex
A repository for "Section complexes of height functions" by Melvin Vaupel, Erik Hermansen and Paul Trygsland (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12617).

A discrete version is given of section spaces and their simplicial structure as described in "Combinatorial models for topological Reeb spaces" by Paul Trygsland (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.05474).
Sections of a height function on a simplicial set, X, associates a bisimplicial set, S_h, whose diagaonal contains the same homotopy type as X.
The Reeb Complex of S_h allows us to track how homology generators flow across height levels of X.
